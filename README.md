# CMPE244-M-B
Morph &amp; Blend - A video-game defined by colour and speed.

M&B is a unique and fast game in which the player has to blend and match with the incoming obstacles.The player is required to control his cube-like character that moves to the right, left and forward directions to make long jumps and change color by these obstacles. Instead of the usual jumping over the barriers and pits, the player has to adapt to them by dynamically changing the characterâ€™s color before landing on the platform. SJTwo board will be used to implement the game logic, control the RGB matrix and the joysticks/switches. The RGB matrix will be used to display the real-time game statistics such as the player name and their score. The game ends if the player lands on an obstacle of a different color.
